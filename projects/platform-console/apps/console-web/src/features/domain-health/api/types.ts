/**
 * `features/domain-health` — wire types for the BFF-routed Phase 7
 * "Domain Health Overview" composition envelope (TASK-PC-FE-013 —
 * ADR-MONO-017 § 3.3 #4 / `console-integration-contract.md` § 2.4.9.2).
 *
 * The wire shape is byte-verbatim from the BE `DomainHealthResponse`
 * Java record landed by the BE half of this same task. Sibling to
 * `features/operator-overview` (TASK-PC-FE-011 / § 2.4.9.1) — they
 * are independent composition surfaces with their own `route` label
 * for the per-leg metrics (`route="domain-health"` here vs
 * `route="operator-overview"` there).
 *
 * Hard invariants (mirrored from § 2.4.9.2 + the BE Javadoc):
 *  - `cards[]` is ALWAYS exactly 5 entries in fixed order
 *    `[gap, wms, scm, finance, erp]`. The screen re-sorts/maps
 *    defensively by `domain` rather than positional order.
 *  - `cards[i].status` ∈ `{ ok, degraded }` ONLY — `forbidden` is
 *    NEVER emitted on this route (no permission outcome exists on a
 *    public actuator leg per the § D4 scope clarification: D4 governs
 *    the data API legs only). A defensive schema MUST reject any
 *    `'forbidden'` literal that would indicate a BE drift.
 *  - On `ok` cards `data` carries the producer's Spring Boot health
 *    JSON, typically `{"status": "UP"}`. The `data.status` slot is the
 *    Spring Boot health enum: `UP` / `DOWN` / `OUT_OF_SERVICE` /
 *    `UNKNOWN`. `DOWN` is a successful health document — NOT a
 *    BFF/network failure (the leg reached the producer; the producer
 *    self-reported critical). Distinction from card-level `degraded`
 *    which means the BFF could not reach the producer at all.
 *  - `asOf` is the server-side composition request timestamp.
 *  - On `degraded` cards `reason` is the narrow union
 *    `{ DOWNSTREAM_ERROR, TIMEOUT, CIRCUIT_OPEN }` (NO permission
 *    classifications on this route — see hard invariant above).
 *
 * READ-ONLY — there is NO mutation surface modelled here (no body
 * schemas; no Idempotency-Key / X-Operator-Reason; no POST/PUT/PATCH/
 * DELETE on this route). The same hard invariant the BE asserts.
